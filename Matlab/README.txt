We here provide the Matlab implementation of scAIG. 

**DEMOS**
We provide two demos for the usage of scAIG in both clustering and visulization implementations.

In demo_scAIG_C.m, we provide the script for clustering on eight data sets with the output as running time, ACC, NMI and ARI. The other output are saved in the sturct called 'out' as follows.
